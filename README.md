## Data-Lemur-Practice

*13 May 2023*

\
Hallo Werld!\
\
So I'm *-checks calendar-* 54 days into unemployment. So far I've survived two technical interviews and didn't totally bomb them!\
(tbh I did quite alright with them but always room for improvements). Nonetheless I should *probably* do some practice q's to combat my\ imposter syndrome and honestly I just kinda miss writing SQL ┬┴┬┴┤(･_├┬┴┬┴

Anyway, I just wanted to create a log of all the questions I go through to see how my solutions measure up to Data Lemur's and possibly\
track progress in writing SQL queries more efficiently ﾟ･:*｡(ꈍᴗꈍ)ε｀*)~｡*:･ﾟ

I wonder if anyone will even read this lol
